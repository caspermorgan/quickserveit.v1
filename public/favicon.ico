[Placeholder: favicon.ico - 16x16 or 32x32 pixel image file]

Note: In production, replace this with an actual .ico file generated from the logo.
You can generate one using tools like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://icoconvert.com/

For now, browsers will gracefully handle a missing favicon and fall back to the site's logo.
Alternatively, add this to your HTML <head>:
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/src/assets/img/logo.png">
